# About me 📂

👋🏼 Hi, I’m Zilma Bezerra, a multilingual professional (English, Spanish and Portuguese) who has embarked on a new journey to be a Data Analyst after more than 10 years of experience in Marketing and Advertising. In 2020, I moved to Ireland to both improve my English, and have the experience of living abroad. In 2022, I decided to change careers and started a Higher Diploma in Science in Data Analytics for Business, where I recently achieved a **First-class Honours degree** 🥇. I am also studying Project Management. I believe these three areas together are really powerful and useful to help businesses succeed.

- 🥰 I’m interested in coffee, books, cats and dancing, besides Python.
- 🌱 I’m always looking for something new to learn.
- 🤝 I’m looking forward to collaborating on projects that are meaningful for society.
- 📧 Don’t hesitate to reach me by e-mail (zilmakarlla@gmail.com) if you are a student looking for help or a company that wants to offer me a job.
